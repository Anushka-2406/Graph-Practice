# Graph-Practice

1. Topological Sort : Linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between u and v then u appears before v in that ordering.
(Only in DAG).

 ## Questions : 
_When the question is about something before something or cycle detection.

1. Detect cycle in Directed graph (We will implement topo sort using bfs [Kahn's Algo] and then if topo.size()<N then it is because there is a cycle in it.)
2. Course schedule 1 and 2
      In 1 ; we just have to check for cycle, if not return true.
      In 2 : if no cycle, then return topo sort answer vector else return empty string.

3. Find Eventual Safe states : (Reverse the graph and store the topo sort. The oneâ€™s which are not safe nodes will automatically not implemented.)

4. Alien Dictionary
5. Shortest path in DAG
6. Shortest path in undirected graph with unit weights.
7. Word ladder 1 and 2
